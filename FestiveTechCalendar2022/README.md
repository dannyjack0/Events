# Festive Tech Calendar 2022

### Overview
The Festive Tech Calendar is a technical community initiative geared towards sharing information. Throughput December there will be lots of new content published from people all over the globe.

### Supporting the Missing People Charity
This year the Festive Tech Calendar Team are raising money for the charity **@missingpeople**. We believe its important to support charities who do great work. Without fundraising Missing People wouldnâ€™t be able to find vulnerable missing people and reunite families.

## What are we going to do?
We are going to build out a lab using Terraform. The lab will include the following services and features.
- Resource groups
- Virtual Networks
- Subnets
- Virtual Machines
- Azure Keyvault
- ANF Accounts
- ANF Capacity Pools
- ANF Volumes
